							<h1>A Multi-Sensor Approach to Determine the Impacts of Human Activity and Natural Surface Deformation on the Black Rock Playa, Nevada</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/SAR GIF.gif" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The Black Rock Playa has experienced increased erosion with possible sources including drought, natural processes, and anthropogenic activity –
								 although some members of the community believe that Burning Man, a festival hosted annually on the playa, may be the primary culprit. With Burning Man's
								  recent request to increase its population capacity, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) must evaluate the event's environmental impact through submission
								   of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). To better understand contributing factors to mound growth and migration, I assisted a team with assessing landscape
								    changes from 1997 to 2017. Surface deformation maps were generated with Sentinel 1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), in conjunction with Landsat 5 and Landsat 8.
									  Historic weather data from Black Rock Playa and Gerlach, Nevada weather stations were used to place surface morphology observations in the context of typical
									   drought years, flooding events, and wind patterns. </p>
