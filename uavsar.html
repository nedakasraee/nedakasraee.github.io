							<h1>UAVSAR Work</h1>
							<p>I wore many hats for this role. I was hired to work for one of NASA's airborne science teams where I was tasked with flight planning logistics. I worked with many collaborators and coordinated large-scale airborne campaigns. I also processed large quantities of geospatial data (airborne, satellite, SAR, optical) and vector data (weather data, vegetation data, field data) with GIS and coding for different teams and projects at JPL. The projects I worked on had wide-ranging applications in earth sciences including projects that studied flooding, erosion, natural disasters, agriculture, and forestry. I documented technical procedures for the team on processing workflows and flight planning logistics. I engaged the public and NASA collaborators by creating outreach materials such as ArcGIS Online maps and presentations. I designed maps and conducted GIS analyses to provide input for the preparation of proposals. I also conducted fieldwork measuring trees to collect validation data for a large-scale airborne science mission.</p>
